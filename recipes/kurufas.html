    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kuru fasulye is a stewed bean dish in Turkish cuisine. It is made primarily with white beans and olive oil, and onion and tomato paste or tomato sauce are almost invariably used. Sometimes other vegetables or meat may also be added, especially pastirma. Kuru fasulye is often served along with cacik and rice or bulgur. It is often considered the national dish of Turkey</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>3 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 White Onion, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 Carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 Celery Sticks, chopped</li>
        <li>800 g Canned Cannellini Beans, drained</li>
        <li>400 g Tinned Chopped Tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Tomato Pur√©e</li>
        <li>600 ml Water</li>
        <li>1/2 Lemon, juiced - to taste</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 handful Chopped Fresh Parley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large and deep saucepan or casserole dish, over a medium heat add the olive oil</li>
        <li>Add the onions and soften for a couple of minutes</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and celery and lightly fry until soft</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the canned beans and add to the saucepan, add the tomato puree and chopped tomatoes, combine well</li>
        <li>Using the tomato can to measure, add the water (one and a half cans of water is roughly 600ml)</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil and simmer for around 30 minutes with the lid only half way covering the top to allow the steam to escape</li>
        <li>Halfway through add the lemon juice to taste (you may not want all the lemon juice, taste the sauce to see how much you want)</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste and continue to simmer</li>
        <li>Once the 30 minutes is up, stir and leave uncovered for 10-15 minutes until the tomato sauce has started to thicken and become a soup like texture</li>
        <li>Sprinkle over the chopped fresh parsley before serving</li>
        <li>Serve in a bowl with fresh bread or with a side of rice, salad and Turkish or Greek Yoghurt</li>
